# Network-Log-Utility-Project
 In this project, we are given a network log file that includes information about connections between devices. Log files contain information about running specific software.
 In the log file that is given in the text file, we have a list of timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, packet sizes and comments. Due to their size and structure,
 software is needed to analyze and extract patterns from a log file's content. In this project I use a set of methods to parse, filter and query a network log file.
 We have two Java classes, a read-only class container for each log entry and utility class.
